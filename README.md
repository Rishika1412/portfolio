# My First Portfolio Website - Built with Flutter

Hello everyone!

I am thrilled to introduce my very first portfolio website, which I built using Flutter. This project is a significant milestone in my journey as a developer, and I'm very excited to share the fruits of my labor.

## Overview

For this project, I started by forking the portfolio website repository originally developed by Hamza[https://github.com/mhmzdev/devfolio]. I chose this repository due to its great structure and impressive design. However, I made sure to customize it, adding my unique touch and ensuring it reflected my identity and skills.

## Modifications

The main modifications I made to the code include:

1. **Content Replacement**: All the text content and images have been replaced to represent my profile, experience, skills, and projects.
2. **Color Scheme Adjustment**: The original color palette was replaced with one that aligns better with my personal brand.
3. **Feature Addition/Removal**: Depending on the relevance to my personal profile, some features were added, while others were removed.
4. **Bug Fixes**: I've also fixed any bugs or issues that I encountered during the process of personalization.

## Technologies Used

This project was created using Flutter, a fantastic UI toolkit by Google. Flutter has a unique feature: it allows one codebase to create applications for multiple platforms. In this case, I utilized it for building a responsive website.

## Learning Experience

Developing this portfolio was an excellent learning opportunity. I got to dig deep into Flutter's documentation, best practices, and community. This project also helped me better understand the process of forking and modifying an existing codebase. I look forward to incorporating these learnings into future projects.

## Acknowledgements

I want to express my gratitude towards Hamza[https://github.com/mhmzdev] for creating the initial codebase for this portfolio website. Their work provided me with a robust foundation to learn, modify and create my own personal portfolio website.

## Conclusion

It has been a fantastic journey building my first website using Flutter. I welcome any feedback or suggestions. Please feel free to explore my site and get in touch with me!
